# SainsburysTechTest
Sainsburys backend tech test

This test has been compiled and can be run with Gradle.  I found this to be the most up to date dependency handler and made developing the 
application a lot simpler.

#Instructions
Clone the repository, change into the SainsburysTechTest subfolder, run gradlew build (on Windows) or ./gradlew build on Linux
This builds the code, and runs the Unit tests outputting the results into the build/test-results folder.  All tests
should pass

The application can be run using gradlew run on windows or ./gradlew run on Linux.

Fully enjoyed completing this test!
